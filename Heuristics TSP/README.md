# Optimisation
Routing, Inventory and Supply Chain optimisation using heuristics 

Implementations of various construction heuristics and Local Search algorithms in MATLAB

## Overview

- This repository contains several of the (Traveling Salesman Problem) projects

- These projects revolved around solving TSP-LIB (see: [TSP-LIB](https://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/)) EUC-2D (n ≤ 500) instances by using heuristics

- The MATLAB implementation is provided for
  - The following 7 construction heuristics:
    - [the Nearest Neighbour (NN) algorithm](construct_heuristics/near_neighbour.m)
    - [the Nearest Merger (NM) algorithm](construct_heuristics/near_merger.m)
    - [the Clarke & Wright (C&W) Savings algorithm](construct_heuristics/clarke_wright.m)

## Explanation of terms

A heuristic aims to generate high quality solutions but cannot guarantee to find the optimal solution.

A construction heuristic is a type of heuristic defined by Kahng and Reda (2004) as an alternative to an exact solution that performs a sequence of operations until a valid tour is obtained, at which point the heuristic stops and reports the constructed tour. 

A Classical Local Search (CLS) algorithm is a type of heuristic that “operates using a single state and its set of neighbours” (Nunes De Castro, 2002). 

## Explanation of algorithms

### Construction Heuristics

#### Nearest Neighbour (NN)
- Starts with an empty solution, randomly selects a starting point and repeatedly extends the current solution by selecting the nearest node to the last node selected. This process is repeated until each node in the TSP instance has been visited once only, resulting in a complete unique tour being generated. 
#### Nearest Merger
- Starts with n sub-tours, each containing one node. Then, it finds the two closest sub-tours, where the distance between any pair of nodes in the selected two sub-tours is minimal. After that, it merges the two selected sub-tours based on minimum insertion cost criterion. This process repeats until each node in the instance has been included in one complete tour.
#### Clarke & Wright Savings Algorithm
- A commonly studied greedy heuristic that selects a central node as starting point. The algorithm then computes the savings that can be obtained by linking two nodes rather than visiting them individually. Based upon the highest amount of savings, two nodes are linked together. This process continues until a complete tour has been created.
#### Insertion Procedures 
All of the insertion procedures start with a sub-tour and iteratively determine which of the remaining nodes shall be inserted into the sub-tour next (the selection step) and where (between which two nodes) it should be inserted (the insertion step).
- Farthest Insertion 
    - Expands the current sub-tour by inserting the remaining nodes, which have the maximum distance from any node in the current sub-tour. Where the selected node should be inserted is based on the minimum insertion cost criterion.
- Cheapest Insertion 
    - Determines simultaneously which node not already in the sub-tour should join the sub-tour next and where it should be inserted, using the minimum insertion cost criterion.
- Arbitrary Insertion
    - Selects randomly a node not already in the sub-tour to join the sub-tour and inserts it using the minimum insertion cost criterion.
- Nearest Insertion
    - Selects the node which has the minimum distance from any node in the current sub-tour and inserts it using the minimum insertion cost criterion.
    
### Classical Local Search (CLS) algorithms

#### Random Descent 
The Random Descent differs to the Steepest Descent, since the neighbours are randomly generated and the current seed solution is replaced by the first neighbour that improves the objective function. This process is repeated until it meets a specified constraint.

#### Steepest Descent
The Steepest Descent algorithm explores the entire search space to identify the best improving neighbour. Once implemented, the process is repeated on the newly created seed solution until no improvement can be found. 

#### Difference between 2-opt and 3-opt
The 2-opt algorithm is described by Blazinskas and Misevicius (2011) as simple and in its naive form, involves repeatedly breaking two edges in a tour and reconnecting them in another cost decreasing way until no positive gain 2-opt move can be found. The time complexity for naive 2-opt is 𝑂(𝑛^2). It is outlined by Blazinskas and Misevicius (2011) that when breaking edges in an existing tour, there are (𝑘−1)!∗ 2^((𝑘−1) ) ways to reconnect it, including the initial tour. 

The 3-opt algorithm works in a similar way to the 2-opt algorithm but removes and reconnects three edges rather than two. The time complexity for 3-opt is 𝑂(𝑛^3) but can be improved through techniques that are not explored in this report. It is outlined by Blazinskas and Misevicius (2011) that when breaking edges in an existing tour, there are (𝑘−1)!∗ 2^((𝑘−1) ) ways to reconnect it, including the initial tour.
